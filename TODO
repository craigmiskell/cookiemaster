Popup:
  Fix wrap of primary sub-domains when displaying other cookies (shouldn't wrap) once it needs a vertical scroll bar.  THis may be unfixable; firefox "should" widen the popup when the scrollbar is put in, but doesn't, so everything has to wrap.  Did experiment with setting document.body.style = "width: <something calculated>" but that was fragile and breaky, and seems unwise.
  Right justify domains (Other at least, possibly primary?).  May require tables, for my sins.  It's possible a solution to this may help the wrapping too (by coincidence)

Consider setting the pageAction icons based on allowed/blocked for first party cookies, on active tab.
    This will require noticing when the active tab changes and updating.

Convert the uses of plain javascript objects to Map, where possible
